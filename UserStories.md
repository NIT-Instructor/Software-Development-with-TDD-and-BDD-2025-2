**So that** I can confirm that it behaves predictably when first instantiated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a newly instantiated object,  
- **When** it is initialized,  
- **Then** all internal properties should have appropriate default values.

### **User Story 2.2: Process Uniform Data in a Class**

**As a developer,**  
I want to ensure that a class method can process a uniform set of data,  
**So that** I can verify its behavior with consistent input.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** an object containing uniform data,  
- **When** the processing method is called,  
- **Then** the method should return the expected result.

### **User Story 2.3: Process Varying Data in a Class**

**As a developer,**  
I want to test how a class method handles varying input data,  
**So that** I can confirm it processes diverse inputs correctly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** an object with varying data,  
- **When** the method is called,  
- **Then** the method should return the correct result based on the input data.

### **User Story 2.4: Update Internal Data with New Values**

**As a developer,**  
I want to update a class’s internal data with new values,  
**So that** it can process fresh input without affecting old data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** an object with internal data,  
- **When** the update method is called with new input,  
- **Then** the internal data should be updated and reflect the new state correctly.

## **Exercise 3: Using Mocks and Dependency Injection**

### **User Story 3.1: Use Mocked Dependencies in a Class**

**As a developer,**  
I want to test a class by injecting mocked dependencies,  
**So that** I can isolate the class's behavior and ensure it interacts correctly with its dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a mock version of a dependency,  
- **When** it is injected into the class,  
- **Then** I should be able to control the behavior of the mock and verify the class's interactions with it.

### **User Story 3.2: Simulate Failure of a Dependency**

**As a developer,**  
I want to simulate failure conditions in a class's dependencies,  
**So that** I can verify how the class handles errors or unexpected behavior from its dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a mocked dependency that simulates failure,  
- **When** the class interacts with it,  
- **Then** the class should handle the failure according to its design.

### **User Story 3.3: Verify Dependency Injection Works Correctly**

**As a developer,**  
I want to ensure that a class correctly uses the dependency I inject into it,  
**So that** I can confirm that dependency injection is functioning as intended.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a dependency injected into the class,  
- **When** the class interacts with the dependency,  
- **Then** it should use the injected version for all operations.

## **Exercise 4: Mocking External Libraries and Testing Complex Interactions**

### **User Story 4.1: Test Class Behavior with External System Interactions**

**As a developer,**  
I want to simulate interactions between my class and an external system,  
**So that** I can ensure that the class works correctly with external dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a class that interacts with an external system (e.g., a hardware library),  
- **When** I simulate or mock the external interactions,  
- **Then** the class should behave as expected when interacting with the external system.

### **User Story 4.2: Test Complex Data Flow Between Components**

**As a developer,**  
I want to test how multiple components interact within a class,  
**So that** I can verify that the system functions correctly when data flows between multiple components.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** multiple interacting components within a system,  
- **When** data flows through the components,  
- **Then** the system should process the data correctly and respond as expected.

## **Exercise 5: Acceptance Testing with Real Implementations**

### **User Story 5.1: Test System Under Normal Conditions**

**As a tester,**  
I want to simulate normal operating conditions for the system,  
**So that** I can verify it functions correctly under expected circumstances.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** the system is running under normal conditions,  
- **When** data is processed,  
- **Then** the system should perform all operations correctly and maintain its normal state.

### **User Story 5.2: Test System Under Stressful or Extreme Conditions**

**As a tester,**  
I want to simulate stressful or extreme conditions for the system,  
**So that** I can ensure it responds appropriately to unexpected or challenging situations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** the system is under extreme conditions,  
- **When** certain thresholds or limits are breached,  
- **Then** the system should transition to an error or alert state and take appropriate actions.

### **User Story 5.3: Validate Interaction Between System Components**

**As a tester,**  
I want to verify that the system’s components interact correctly with one another,  
**So that** I can confirm the system as a whole functions as intended.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** a system with multiple interacting components,  
- **When** data is passed between these components,  
- **Then** the system should process the data correctly and update its state accordingly.

### **Optional User Story: Refactor Legacy Code for Testability**

**As a developer,**  
I want to refactor legacy code to improve testability,  
**So that** I can introduce automated tests and enhance maintainability without breaking existing functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Given** legacy code with no current tests,  
- **When** I refactor it for testability,  
- **Then** I should be able to introduce automated tests that validate the code's functionality.
